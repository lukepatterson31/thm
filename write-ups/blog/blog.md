### Exploitation

Use kweel's credentials and the metasploit module WordPress Crop-image Shell Upload to gain a remote shell

Check suid/sgid binaries with find:

`find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null`

Found an unknown binary in /usr/sbin called checker

Analyse it with ltrace to find it evaluates the admin variable

Setting admin=1 and running checker executes a bash shell as root, granting access to user.txt and root.txt
