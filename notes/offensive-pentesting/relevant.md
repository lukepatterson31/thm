### Pre-engagement briefing

**Scope of Work**

The client requests that an engineer conducts an assessment of the provided virtual 
environment. The client has asked that minimal information be provided about the assessment, 
wanting the engagement conducted from the eyes of a malicious actor (black box penetration 
test).  The client has asked that you secure two flags (no location provided) as proof of 
exploitation:

- User.txt
- Root.txt

Additionally, the client has provided the following scope allowances:

- Any tools or techniques are permitted in this engagement, however we ask that you attempt 
manual exploitation first
- Locate and note all vulnerabilities found
- Submit the flags discovered to the dashboard
- Only the IP address assigned to your machine is in scope
- Find and report ALL vulnerabilities (yes, there is more than one path to root)

### Passive Recon

IP of target resolves to an IIS Windows Server

### Active Recon

[nmap scan](./relevant.nmap) `nmap -sC -v <TARGET-IP> -oN relevant.nmap`
more thorough scans needed (more ports, different scan type, specific service scanning)

 Check IIS config web.config
