# Gatekeeper

Services:

- SMB 445 
- Elite 31337 

Smb enumeration shows the Users directory is accessible anonymously

Contents include two directories, Share and Default. Share contains gatekeeper.exe and 
Default contains user files for the default user.

gatekeeper.exe is the Elite service running on port 31337 and is vulnerable to overflow

EIP offset: 146

Badchars: \x00\x0a

Jump point: \xbf\x16\x04\x08

After gaining initial access use file upload via smb or update the exploit to use a 
meterpreter shell and enumerate with modules.

`post/windows/gather/enum_applications` finds Firefox is installed
`post/multi/gather/firefox_creds` grabs the credentials

You can then use [firefox_decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) to extract credentials and use them to gain SYSTEM with psexec.py
