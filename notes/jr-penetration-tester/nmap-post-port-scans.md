# Nmap Post Port Scans

### Service Detection

`nmap -sV --version-intensity <0-9> <TARGET-IP>`

Using `-sV` forces Nmap to proceed with the 3-way TCP handshake and establish a connection.

### OS Detection and Traceroute

**OS Detection**

`nmap -sS -O <TARGET-IP>`

Needs at least 1 open and 1 closed port and is not 100% accurate

**Traceroute**

Add `--traceroute` to append a traceroute to the scan results
