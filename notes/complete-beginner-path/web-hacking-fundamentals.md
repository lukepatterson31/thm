# Web Hacking Fundamentals

## How Websites Work

When you visit a website, your browser (like Safari or Google Chrome) makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page you're visiting. 
It will respond with data that your browser uses to show you the page; a web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests.

```
		--request from browser-->
BROWSER			INTERNET		SERVER
 		<--response from server--
```

There are two major components that make up a website:

    Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
    Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.

There are many other processes involved in your browser making a request to a web server, but for now, 
you just need to understand that you make a request to a server, and it responds with data your browser uses to render information to you.

## HTTP In Detail

### Requests and Responses

What is a URL? (Uniform Resource Locator)

Scheme: This instructs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

User: Some services require authentication to log in, you can put a username and password into the URL to log in.

Host: The domain name or IP address of the server you wish to access.

Port: The Port that you are going to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, but this can be hosted on any port between 1 - 65535.

Path: The file name or location of the resource you are trying to access.

Query String: Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path. For example, /blog?id=1 would tell the blog path that you wish to receive the blog article with the id of 1.

Fragment: This is a reference to a location on the actual page requested. This is commonly used for pages with long content and can have a certain part of the page directly linked to it, so it is viewable to the user as soon as they access the page.

Making a Request

Example Request:


GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://tryhackme.com/

To breakdown each line of this request:

Line 1: This request is sending the GET method ( more on this in the HTTP Methods task ), request the home page with / and telling the web server we are using HTTP protocol version 1.1.

Line 2: We tell the web server we want the website tryhackme.com

Line 3: We tell the web server we are using the Firefox version 87 Browser

Line 4: We are telling the web server that the web page that referred us to this one is https://tryhackme.com

Line 5: HTTP requests always end with a blank line to inform the web server that the request has finished.

Example Response:


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 98

<html>
<head>
    <title>TryHackMe</title>
</head>
<body>
    Welcome To TryHackMe.com
</body>
</html>

To breakdown each line of the response:

Line 1: HTTP 1.1 is the version of the HTTP protocol the server is using and then followed by the HTTP Status Code in this case "200 Ok" which tells us the request has completed successfully.

Line 2: This tells us the web server software and version number.

Line 3: The current date, time and timezone of the web server.

Line 4: The Content-Type header tells the client what sort of information is going to be sent, such as HTML, images, videos, pdf, XML.

Line 5: Content-Length tells the client how long the response is, this way we can confirm no data is missing.

Line 6: HTTP response contains a blank line to confirm the end of the HTTP response.

Lines 7-14: The information that has been requested, in this instance the homepage.

### HTTP Methods

HTTP methods are a way for the client to show their intended action when making an HTTP request. 

GET Request

This is used for getting information from a web server.

POST Request

This is used for submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records

PUT Request

This is used for submitting data to a web server to update information

DELETE Request

This is used for deleting information/records from a web server.

### HTTP Status Codes

HTTP Status Codes:

Status codes can be broken down into 5 different ranges:

100-199 - Information Response  These are sent to tell the client the first part of their request has been accepted and they should continue sending the rest of their request. These codes are no longer very common.

200-299 - Success   This range of status codes is used to tell the client their request was successful.

300-399 - Redirection   These are used to redirect the client's request to another resource. This can be either to a different webpage or a different website altogether.

400-499 - Client Errors Used to inform the client that there was an error with their request.

500-599 - Server Errors This is reserved for errors happening on the server-side and usually indicate quite a major problem with the server handling the request.

Common HTTP Status Codes:

200 - OK    The request was completed successfully.

201 - Created   A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).

301 - Permanent Redirect    This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.

302 - Temporary Redirect    Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.

400 - Bad Request   This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expected a certain parameter that the client didn't send.

401 - Not Authorised    You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorised with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.

403 - Forbidden You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.

405 - Method Not Allowed    The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.

404 - Page Not Found    The page/resource you requested does not exist.

500 - Internal Service Error    The server has encountered some kind of error with your request that it doesn't know how to handle properly.

503 - Service Unavailable   This server cannot handle your request as it's either overloaded or down for maintenance.

### Headers

Headers are additional bits of data you can send to the web server when making requests.

Although no headers are strictly required when making a HTTP request, you’ll find it difficult to view a website properly.

Common Request Headers

﻿These are headers that are sent from the client (usually your browser) to the server.

Host: Some web servers host multiple websites so by providing the host headers you can tell it which one you require, otherwise you'll just receive the default website for the server.

User-Agent: This is your browser software and version number, telling the web server your browser software helps it format the website properly for your browser and also some elements of HTML, JavaScript and CSS are only available in certain browsers.

Content-Length: When sending data to a web server such as in a form, the content length tells the web server how much data to expect in the web request. This way the server can ensure it isn't missing any data.

Accept-Encoding: Tells the web server what types of compression methods the browser supports so the data can be made smaller for transmitting over the internet.

Cookie: Data sent to the server to help remember your information (see cookies task for more information).

Common Response Headers

These are the headers that are returned to the client from the server after a request.

Set-Cookie: Information to store which gets sent back to the web server on each request (see cookies task for more information).

Cache-Control: How long to store the content of the response in the browser's cache before it requests it again.

Content-Type: This tells the client what type of data is being returned, i.e., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, PDF, Video, etc. Using the content-type header the browser then knows how to process the data.

Content-Encoding: What method has been used to compress the data to make it smaller when sending it over the internet.

### Cookies

You've probably heard of cookies before, they're just a small piece of data that is stored on your computer. Cookies are saved when you receive a "Set-Cookie" header from a web server. 
Then every further request you make, you'll send the cookie data back to the web server. Because HTTP is stateless (doesn't keep track of your previous requests), 
cookies can be used to remind the web server who you are, some personal settings for the website or whether you've been to the website before. 
Let's take a look at this as an example HTTP request:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: cookies.thm           <-- client requests the webpage from `http://cookies.thm`
User-Agent: xxxx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server nginx/1.15.8
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2021 09:08:19 GMT         <-- the server responds back with a simple
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8          webpage with a form asking for the users
                                                name
HTML DATA....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: cookies.thm           
User-Agent: xxxx
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 9
                                        <-- client sends back the form with the name
name=adam                                   set to adam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server nginx/1.15.8
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2021 09:08:19 GMT     
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8      
Set-Cookie: name=adam                   <-- the server responds back with a     
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8      Set-Cookie header telling the client
                                            to save the data name=adam
HTML DATA....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: cookies.thm           <-- On the next and every further request the client
User-Agent: xxxx                sends the cookie data back to the server
Cookie: name=adam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server nginx/1.15.8
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2021 09:08:19 GMT         <-- the server then sees the cookie data and
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8          instead of displaying the form it displays
                                                a welcome back message instead
/<html><body>Welcome Back adam</body></html>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cookies can be used for many purposes but are most commonly used for website authentication. The cookie value won't usually be a clear-text string where you can see the password, 
but a token (unique secret code that isn't easily humanly guessable).
