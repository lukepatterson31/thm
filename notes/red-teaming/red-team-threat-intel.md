# Red Team Threat Intel

### What is Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)
Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
Information and Sharing Analysis Centers (ISACs)

CTI can be consumed by collecting IOCs and TTPs distributed and maintained by ISACs

Defenders use threat intelligence to provide context to the ever-changing threat landscape and quantify 
findings. IOCs are quantified by traces left by adversaries such as domains, IPs, files, strings, etc. 
The blue team can utilize various IOCs to build detections and analyze behavior.

From a red team perspective, you can think of threat intelligence as the red team's analysis of the blue 
team's ability to properly leverage CTI for detections.
