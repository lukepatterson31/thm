# Red Team Engagements

### Defining Scope and Objectives

- Clearly define client objectives or goals  
- Decide how focused the assessment will be, general internal/network pentest or focused adversary emulation  
- Clearly define the scope of the engagement

### Rules of Engagement

RoE are a legally binding outline of the client objectives and scope. The format and wording of the RoE 
are critical since it is a legally binding contract and sets clear expectations.

Standard sections you may see in an RoE:

| Section Name | Section Details |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Executive Summary| Overarching summary of all contents and authorization within RoE document |
| Purpose | Defines why the RoE document is used |
| References | Any references used throughout the RoE document (HIPAA, ISO, etc.) |
| Scope | Statement of the agreement to restrictions and guidelines |
| Definitions | Definitions of technical terms used throughout the RoE document |
| Rules of Engagement and Support Agreement | Defines obligations of both parties and general technical expectations of engagement conduct |
| Provisions | Define exceptions and additional information from the Rules of Engagement |
| Requirements, Restrictions, and Authority | Define specific expectations of the red team cell |
| Ground Rules | Define limitations of the red team cell's interactions |
| Resolution of Issues/Points of Contact | Contains all essential personnel involved in an engagement |
| Authorization | Statement of authorization for the engagement |
| Approval | Signatures from both parties approving all subsections of the preceding document |
| Appendix | Any further information from preceding subsections |

### Campaign Planning

Campaign planning uses the information acquired and planned from the client objectives and RoE and 
applies it to various plans and documents to identify how and what the red team will do.

An example campaign summary adapted from military operations documents:

| Type of Plan | Explanation of Plan | Plan Contents |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Engagement Plan | An overarching description of technical requirements of the red team. | CONOPS, Resource and Personnel Requirements, Timelines |
| Operations Plan | An expansion of the Engagement Plan. Goes further into specifics of each detail. | Operators, Known Information, Responsibilities, etc. |
| Mission Plan | The exact commands to run and execution time of the engagement. | Commands to run, Time Objectives, Responsible Operator, etc. |
| Remediation Plan | Defines how the engagement will proceed after the campaign is finished. | Report, Remediation consultation, etc. |
