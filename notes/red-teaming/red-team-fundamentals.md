# Red Team Fundamentals

### Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Tests Limitations

A **Vulnerability Test**'s main objectives are to identify as many vulnerabilities in as many systems in 
the network as possible. The focus is to identify security issues without exploiting them so effective 
security measures can be deployed to protect the network

A **Penetration Test** attempts to exploit any vulnerabilities found and conduct post-exploitation tasks 
on a compromised machine in addition to identifying as many vulnerabilities as possible. While its focus
remains on identifying vulnerabilities and establishing measures to protect the network, it also 
considers the network as a whole ecosystem and how an attacker could profit from interactions between its 
components.

Pen tests are loud
Non-technical attack vectors may be overlooked (phishing, physical intrusion)
Relaxation of security measures (disabling or relaxing security mechanisms to accommodate time restraints)

Penetration tests differ from actual attacks

### Red Team Engagements

Red Team Engagements test the Blue Team's detection and response to a real threat actor. The Red Team 
emulate a real threat actor's TTPs to measure how well the Blue Team responds to them.

**Attack surfaces:**

- Technical infrastructure (emphasis on stealth and evasion)  
- Social Engineering  
- Physical Intrusion (lock picking, RFID cloning, etc.)  

**Types of excercise:**

- Full Engagement (simulate an attacker's full workflow)  
- Assumed Breach (user credentials or workstation access)  
- Table-top Exercise (theoretical scenarios)
